# Formalizing Friedman's theorem in Lean 4 using strong convergence

The aim of this project is to formalize a result related to the expansion of large random regular graphs, conjectured by [Alon](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02579166) in 1986 and first proven by [Friedman](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/780542.780646) in 2003. The historical proof of this celebrated result is very long and presents several challenges. However, in a recent breakthrough, [Chen, Garza-Vargas, Tropp and van Handel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16026) provided a radically new approach to this class of problems, which allows to prove Friedman's theorem in a very concise self-contained proof. We hope to formalize this new proof.
