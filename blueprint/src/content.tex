\chapter{Random regular graphs}

\section{Degree and regular graphs}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph, i.e. a set of vertices $V$ and edges $E$ (each edge links two
unordered, possibly identical vertices $x$, $y$). We say an edge $e$ is \emph{indicent} to a vertex
$x$ if there exists a vertex $y$ such that $e$ links $x$ and $y$. An edge is a \emph{loop} based at
a vertex $x$ if it links the vertex $x$ to itself.

\begin{definition}
  The \emph{degree} of a vertex $x \in V$ is the number of incident edges, counting loops twice:
  \begin{equation*}
    \mathrm{deg}(x) = \# \{\text{edges incident to } x\}
    + \# \{ \text{loops based at } x\}.
  \end{equation*}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Let $d$ be a non-negative integer. We say $G$ is $d$-regular if every vertex of $G$ has degree $d$.
\end{definition}

\section{Random regular graphs: the permutation model}

In the rest of this blueprint, $N$ is a positive integer, and $[N] = \{1, \ldots, N\}$.
We also fix an even positive integer $d = 2r$.

\begin{definition}
  We denote as $\mathbf{S}_N$ the set of permutations of $[N]$, i.e. bijective maps $\sigma
  : [N] \rightarrow [N]$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  The set $\mathbf{S}_N$ is finite and has cardinality $N!$.
\end{lemma}
We can therefore equip $\mathbf{S}_N$ with the uniform probability measure.

It will be more useful in what follows to view permutations as matrices.

\begin{definition}
  A square matrix is called a \emph{permutation matrix} if all of its entries are equal to $0$ or
  $1$, with exactly one $1$ on each row and column.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  Let $U$ be a permutation matrix. Then, $U$ is invertible and its inverse is the transpose $U^*$ of $U$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{definition}
  Let $\sigma \in \mathbf{S}_N$. We associate to $\sigma$ the $N \times N$ matrix
  $U_\sigma$ by letting, for each $i, j \in [N]$, $(U_\sigma)_{ij} = 1$ if $j = \sigma(i)$. [todo: check]
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  The map $\sigma \mapsto U_\sigma$ is a bijection from $\mathbf{S}_N$ to the set of $N \times N$
  permutation matrices.
\end{lemma}

\section{The infinite $d$-regular tree}

\begin{definition}
  A \emph{walk} from $x$ to $y$ is a sequence of vertices and edges
  $x = v_0, e_1, v_1, \ldots, e_k, v_k = y$ such that for every $1 \leq j \leq k$, the edge $e_j$
  links the vertices $v_{j-1}$ and $v_j$. A walk is a \emph{path} if its edges are all distinct.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  A graph $G$ is called a \emph{tree} if, for any pair of distinct vertices $x$, $y$, there exists
  one unique path from $x$ to $y$.
\end{definition}

[todo: define the infinite $d$-regular tree]
