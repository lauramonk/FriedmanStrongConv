\chapter{Analysis prerequisites}

In this chapter, we prove some results related to the analysis of polynomial and rational
functions, as well as compactly supported distributions.

\section{Compactly supported distributions}

In this section, we will prove a few useful elementary results on distributions.
We denote as $C^\infty(I)$ the space of smooth functions $\R \rightarrow \R$, and $C^\infty_c(\R)$
those with compact support. For $h \in C^\infty_c(\R)$, we denote as $\supp h$ its support.
For real numbers $a < b$ and $h \in C^\infty(\R)$, we write
\begin{equation*}
  \|h\|_{C^m(a,b)} = \sup_{0 \leq k \leq m} \sup_{a \leq x \leq b} |h^{(k)}(x)|
\end{equation*}
where $h^{(k)}$ is the $k$-th order derivative of $h$.
We denote as $\mathcal{D}(\R)$ the space of classical distributions on $\R$, i.e. continuous
linear functionals $\nu : C^\infty_c(\R) \rightarrow \R$.
Here continuous means that, for any real numbers $a < b$, any integer $m \geq 0$,
there exists a constant $C_{a,b,m}$ such that
\begin{equation*}
  \forall h \in C^\infty_c(\R), \quad
  \supp h \subseteq [a,b] \Rightarrow  |\nu(h)| \leq C_{a,b,m} \|h\|_{C^m(a,b)}.
\end{equation*}

We recall the definition of support, which should be added quite soon to Mathlib.

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:support_distribution}
  Let $\nu \in \mathcal{D}(\R)$.
  The \emph{support} of $\nu$ is the intersection of all closed sets $A \subseteq \R$
  such that $\nu$ vanishes on the complement of $A$. We denote it as $\supp \nu$.
\end{definition}
